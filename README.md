================

Red Gate Database for SQL in the City and [Bay Area Meetup](http://bit.ly/13DQqpO) presentations


* You can restore a copy of the RGDemo database in from the DatabaseBackup folder.
* You can also restore the same database as RGDemo_DEV, RGDemo_QA and RGDemo_PROD on your same machine
* If you install Jenkins, you can configure a new Job using the settings in the JenkinsConfig folder


When creating this database locally, make sure you set the TRUSTWORTHY attribute to ON so that the CLR assembly can be created.

    ALTER DATABASE [RGDemo] SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
    GO
